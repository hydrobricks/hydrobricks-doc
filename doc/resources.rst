Using hydrobricks
-----------------

* Repository providing a structured, reproducible workflow to set up, calibrate, and analyse hydrological discharge simulations in alpine catchments using the HydroBricks modelling framework: https://github.com/MilesThomi/Hydrobricks-getting-started


Postprocessing
--------------

* Code for downscaling hydrobricks outputs to sub-daily timescales (daily flow duration curves) in alpine glacierized catchments: https://github.com/ALArgentin/glacial-discharge-downscaling
